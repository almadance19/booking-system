                    1. A weekly stress-relief session (therapy costs $150/hour)<br>
                    2. A new social circle (meetup groups charge fees too)<br>
                    3. Increased confidence that impacts your work and relationships<br>
                    4. A fun workout you'll actually stick with<br><br>
                    Compared to a gym membership you might not use, or a therapist, this is actually quite economical for the transformation, wouldn't you agree?"

                    • Had joint issues and found dance gentler than the gym<br>
